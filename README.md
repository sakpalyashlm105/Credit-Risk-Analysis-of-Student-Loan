# Credit-Risk-Analysis-of-Student-Loan
### Problem Statement:
The objective of this project is to analyze student loan data and assess whether specific loan characteristics from the "Origination Data.csv" file can predict the Early Risk Score, indicating poor credit performance. Additionally, the "Performance.xlsx" file provides a performance summary of the loans. The goal is to examine the data, identify significant loan features, and determine their predictive power in relation to the Early Risk Score.

### Data Description:
The project involves two data files: "Origination Data.csv" and "Performance.xlsx". The "Origination Data.csv" file contains information about originated student loans, including various loan characteristics. On the other hand, the "Performance.xlsx" file provides a summary of loan performance, with the Early Risk Score serving as an indicator of credit risk (higher scores correspond to riskier loans).

### Project Summary:
The project entails the following steps:

- Data Understanding:

Load and examine the "Origination Data.csv" and "Performance.xlsx" files.
Gain an understanding of the loan characteristics and performance metrics present in the data.
Data Analysis:

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the loan origination data.
Identify relevant loan characteristics that could potentially impact the Early Risk Score.
Assess the relationship between loan features and the Early Risk Score through statistical analysis and visualization.
Feature Selection:

- Utilize appropriate feature selection techniques to identify the most predictive loan characteristics.
Consider techniques such as correlation analysis, feature importance, or statistical tests to determine the key features.
Model Building:

- Develop a predictive model to estimate the Early Risk Score based on the selected loan characteristics.
Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm, such as logistic regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods.
Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
Model Evaluation:

- Evaluate the performance of the predictive model using appropriate evaluation metrics.
Assess the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine its effectiveness in predicting the Early Risk Score.
Utilize techniques like cross-validation or holdout validation to validate the model's performance.
Interpretation and Conclusion:

- Interpret the findings from the analysis and model results.
Identify the loan characteristics that significantly contribute to the prediction of the Early Risk Score.
Draw conclusions regarding the predictive power of loan features and their potential implications for credit risk analysis in student loans.
By following this project pipeline, we aim to gain insights into the relationship between loan characteristics and the Early Risk Score in student loans. The analysis will provide valuable information for credit risk assessment and help in identifying key factors influencing loan performance
